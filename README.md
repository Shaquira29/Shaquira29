# Welcome to my Github page!
## About Me
- 👋***Hi, I am Shaquira***
- 👀 I am currently transitioning into a new career in tech and feel my tenacity and drive will enable me to become a valuable team asset.
  ☑️ In December 2023 I enrolled onto a 16-week software engineering skills bootcamp with HyperionDev, to begin my coding journey and it has been
      an amazing experience.
  💻 This journey has taught me how to problem solve at a deeper level, how to remain patient to believe in a process and to enjoy learning and applying a new skill.
  
### ***My Aspirations***
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the Python language but would be open to learning more languages as I go along to deepen my knowledge and tech stack.
- 💞️ It would be great to collaborate with other tech enthusiasts, as I am always ready to learn and grasp new skills.
  
### **Outside of the tech space**
💎 In addition to tech, I have a keen interest and soon will begin a journey in learning British Sign Language (BSL). 
    This has been a passion of mine for some time, as I believe it is important to broaden my ability to supporting others.
